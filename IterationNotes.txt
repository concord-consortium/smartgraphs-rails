Incomplete list of things needed to deploy:

* setup database.yml appropriately. To use sqlite, you can just copy config/database.sample.yml to config/database.yml. Don't commit database.yml!

* run rake db:setup to get started (this will populate the Sproutcore fixture data for Activity and ActivityPage)

* If you want to run the dev server, it will host everything with the url prefix /backend. This includes static assets like the CSS, JS, and static HTML in the /public directory. In production, you'll want to serve these from / rather than /backend; I'm not sure how to tell Rails to do this.

* Regarding the above, if you're using script/server, you want to run `script-server --path=/backend`. This will correctly serve the static assets at /backend, so sc-server will serve, for example, your Rails css.



setup log, 8/5/2010:

gem install rspec-rails
gem install sqlite3
(setup .rvmrc)
(setup .gitignore)
rake db:create
script/generate controller home index
rm public/index.html
(remove default routes)
(set home route)
script/server rspec_scaffold Activity title:string
rake db:migrate
(add config.action_controller.relative_url_root = '/backend' to config/environments.rb)
(update routes to use /activities for index and /activity/nnn for show)

  script/generate rspec_scaffold ActivityPage name:string index:integer intro_text:string
  rake db:migrate
  OOPS: (realize intro_text should have been intro_text:text)
  git reset --hard 7df5965a42
  rake db:drop
  rake db:create
  rake db:schema:load

trying again:

script/generate rspec_scaffold ActivityPage name:string index:integer intro_text:text
rake db:migrate

(fix routes to be nested)

OOPS: don't want to use scaffold generator

script/generate rspec_model ActivityPage activity:references name:string index:integer intro_text:text
rake db:migrate

script/generate rspec_controller ActivityPageController index show new edit
oops .. rename ActivityPageController -> ActivityPageController (rename spec/controllers/activity_page_controller & app/controllers/activity_page_controller)

(fleshed out controller methods and templates to get some basic editing)
